<h1>"My body is ready."</h1>
<h2>Reggie Fils-Aime, 2007</h2>
<p>Super Smash Brothers is a fighting series that was the brain child of Masahiro Sakurai, creator of Kirby. He knew that fighting games weren't the most popular, he wanted to have a unique idea for it. It formed into having Nintendo characters fill the roster of fighters. He figured this wouldn't receive permission from his superiors, so he worked on a proto-type secretly until he felt it would play well. Once this was accomplished, he presented his idea and was given the green light.</p>
<p>Now the series has four successors to the original that was released for the Nintendo 64, with a roster that started at 12 now as high as 77, with more to be downloadable. This game has impacted the gaming community greatly becoming a staple with every new Nintendo system release. With the competitive nature of the game, professional players have emerged to the E-sports scene. It has become such a large influence that some of these players receive sponsorships and are invited to professional tournaments. For passionate players to the people who just like to have fun it isn't a party until Smash Bros. is played.</p>
<p>Since 1999 more characters have been added, stages and different modes of play made the series fresh and revolutionary, eventually even breaking the limit of the Nintendo Franchise; adding characters and references from other game companies. Now with the upcoming release of Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, we are looking forward to a complete experience with plenty of new editions to gameplay, roster, and much more still to be revealed. This site is made to explain the reason why you should be absolutely pumped for the newest installment to this series.</p>
